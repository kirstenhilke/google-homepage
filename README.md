Introduction

The first project from the Odin Project's curriculum is a mini-project to learn basic practical skills in programming. The goal of the mini-project is to deconstruct the Google homepage and rebuild it, but simplified. Required are the basic structure, elements, style and alignment of the Google homepage, but without its functionality in detail.
